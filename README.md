Fan Updates & Fixes by U.E. Admiral (Nobody and nowhere special)
Version 4.2.11
Updated November 1st, 2017

---------- 

Installation Instructions: 
1. Locate and duplicate your Artemis directory. 
2. Rename the duplicate to differentiate your vanilla Artemis directory from the copy you're modding. The name doesn't matter. For the purposes of these instructions I will assume you named it "ArtemisCopy". 
3. Copy the contents of the Ben's Mod "dat" folder into the ArtemisCopy\dat folder and replace the previously existing vesselData.xml, logo512.png, Longbow.dxs, and Longbow.snt files.
4. Copy the Ben's Mod "artemis.ini" file into the ArtemisCopy folder and replace the existing artemis.ini file. 
5. Copy the Ben's Mod "Ben" folder into the ArtemisCopy folder.

That's it! 
A video tutorial for installation is available here: https://youtu.be/eZjZZfshyrw

Uninstallation: 
- Delete your ArtemisCopy folder.

Known Bugs: 
- The game will crash if a player exits Ship Customization while more than 8 of the Tsunami Battle Carrier's 9 carried craft are assigned to be something specific by the player, regardless of what is assigned or how many of a given assignment. Safe arrangements must have at least one of the 9 carried craft be "unassigned".
- The game will crash if a player exits Ship Customization while more than 6 of the Jump Starbase's 11 carried craft are assigned to be something specific by the player, regardless of what is assigned or how many of a given assignment. Safe arrangements must have at least 5 of the 11 carried craft be "unassigned".
